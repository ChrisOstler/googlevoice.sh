Being able to control Google Voice from the command line allows for
unique ways of interacting with telephony services.  Although there
are existing utilities for doing so (i.e. pygooglevoice), they have
significant dependencies.

Originally intended to be deployed on an OpenWRT router running
Asterisk, googlevoice.sh allows dialing Google Voice from the command
line, and depends only on wget, sed, and mktemp.

Usage:
googlevoice.sh login password call_number forwarding_number
